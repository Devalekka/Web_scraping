## 📊 Key Steps

### 1. Web Scraping
- Scraped 100 quotes, authors, and tags from 10 pages.
- Cleaned and structured the data into a pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed unique authors and their frequency.
- Identified missing values and trends in tags.
- Asked key questions and tested hypotheses like:
  - "Do famous authors write longer quotes?"
  - "Are specific tags dominated by particular authors?"

### 3. Data Visualization
- Created various visualizations:
  - Top authors by quote count
  - Tag frequency distribution
  - Word cloud of most used words
  - Author vs Tag dominance heatmap

### 4. Sentiment Analysis
- Applied sentiment polarity scoring (positive/negative/neutral).
- Visualized the sentiment spread across all quotes.
